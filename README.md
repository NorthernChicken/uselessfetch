# uselessfetch
There are too many useful [fetches](https://github.com/beucismis/awesome-fetch#os) out there, so here's a useless one. Ever wanted to not get any useful information about your system? No? Well, too bad.

# Installation
1. ```git clone https://github.com/NorthernChicken/uselessfetch```
2. ```cd uselessfetch```
3. ```chmod +x uselessfetch```
4. ```./uselessfetch```

Try running a couple times, outputs *should* be random each time.

# Known Issues
* Tux isn't colored
* "Random" outputs sometimes repeat twice or thrice for some reason
